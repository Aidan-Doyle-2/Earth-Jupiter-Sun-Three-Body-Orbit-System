# Gravitational Interactions in the Earthâ€“Jupiterâ€“Sun System

This project numerically simulates the three-body gravitational system of the Earth, Jupiter, and the Sun to study how Jupiter influences Earthâ€™s orbital stability and eccentricity. The work explores how small perturbations from Jupiter can alter Earthâ€™s perihelion and aphelion over time.

## ðŸš€ Overview

- Implements two-body (Earthâ€“Sun, Jupiterâ€“Sun) and full three-body systems  
- Uses **SciPyâ€™s ODEINT** to integrate equations of motion  
- Visualizes orbits and long-term stability using **Matplotlib**  
- Analyzes effects of varying Jupiterâ€™s mass on orbital eccentricity and semi-major axis  
- Demonstrates concepts relevant to the **Milankovitch cycles** and planetary perturbations  

## ðŸ§® Methods

Equations of motion were solved numerically in Cartesian coordinates using Newtonian gravity.  
Simulations include:
- Stable orbit validation via velocity tuning  
- Multi-mass perturbation analysis  
- Animation of orbital trajectories using Matplotlibâ€™s `FuncAnimation`

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter / Spyder environment
